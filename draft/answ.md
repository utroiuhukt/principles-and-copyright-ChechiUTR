3.- What is the difference between "open source" and "free software"?
    R: The difference between this types of code is that the open source programs share their code to everyone, so in that way, community can make changes to the program. And the free software dosen't share their code, just share their program for free. 


Critical reflection

After reading the Article "AI and copyright" I notice some things that I haven't notice before.

For example, never since I've heard about AI asked to myself if there was a trouble about copyrights and the fact that most of the AI's are trained using illegal databases, such as the "Anna's Archive" itself, but now that I am more conscious about thee copyrights, licenses and how all this seems to be unfair, morally incorrectly and even harmful to everyone who wants to have acces to any kind of knowledge (books, articles, software, magazines, movies) and since I've read this article I already have an opinion. 

The article makes some suggestions and changes to copyrights laws in western countries (Especially US) in order to let the authors get compensated for their work, and also letting the opportunity to others for using any material for any purppouse.

And also suggest letting AI companies, libraries and archives to opperate legally, even if they use copyright material.

I think the suggestions are OK if we want to look up for the beneffit of both sides (users and companies), but more for the users  beneffit.
